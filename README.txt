This tool is a very simple tool to ensure that a web address is valid or not
ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
There are many tools for doing this.
But I put this in my gate hub so that those who need it,
do not have the opportunity to rewrite this tool that was already written and use this very simple tool.


using => 
git clone https://github.com/the-h3x/check-valid.git
cd check-valid
python3 validator.py
